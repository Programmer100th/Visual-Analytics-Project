## World's Monuments
**World's Monuments** is a web application that aims to let travellers discover new **interesting places**, and also to make people aware about the importance and the beauty of the cultural sites all around the world.
In other words, we want to provide the **ultimate travel guide**, highlighting interesting aspects thanks to our visualizations.
